# Caribbean Adventures - Documentation Structure

This repository's docs folder organizes the Afro-Caribbean business plan into clear, navigable sections.
Each subfolder contains templates and reference materials aligned to the CE Group business plan.

- Folders:
- - `docs/Territories/` - per-territory READMEs under Territories
- `docs/business-plan/` - detailed sections of the plan
- `docs/market/` - market insights and analyses
- `docs/branding/` - brand identity guidelines and visuals
- `docs/finance/` - financial projections and cost models
- `docs/templates/` - starter templates for new sections
- `docs/index.md` - quick reference guide (not yet created)

Templates in `docs/templates/` are meant to accelerate new plan iterations and ensure consistency.
